# About DocuSnap

DocuSnap is a comprehensive document processing and form automation system that combines mobile document scanning with intelligent backend processing. The system consists of two main components:

- **Frontend (Android)**: A mobile application for document scanning, form processing, and user interaction
- **Backend (Python)**: A robust server-side system for OCR processing, LLM integration, and data management

This documentation provides detailed insights into the architecture, technology choices, and implementation details of both components.
