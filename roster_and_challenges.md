#  Team Roster and Individual Contribution

## Zijun Yang

His primary contributions to the project included serving as project manager, handling server development, and conducting extensive debugging of the app's backend. As **project manager**, he took ownership of task assignment, app design, feasibility analysis, workload breakdown, and progress tracking. His strategic approach to parallel task delegation enhanced development efficiency, allowing the team to deliver a highly refined application. As the **sole server developer**, he designed and implemented all [server code](https://github.com/JI-DeepSleep/DocuSnap-Backend), which incorporated LLM prompt engineering for all core features, a cache system, an OCR system, security protocols, and an asynchronous request-response model. Completing the server ahead of schedule facilitated smoother app development. In mid-July, he dedicated significant effort to **debugging the app backend**—removing mockup data, connecting the app database with the UI, fixing the encryption/decryption and codec module, redesigning the database schema to enable image storage, and ensuring seamless integration of all submodules.

## Jingjia Peng

Her primary contributions to the project included serving as the project’s chief UI/UX designer and frontend developer, leading the Android client’s design and implementation. As the **UI/UX designer**, she took ownership of task assignments for interface development, prototyping the app’s visual and interaction design using [Canva whiteboard](https://www.canva.cn/design/DAGtJNhpjDg/sxc4X2GD4eNQcHtYeQHYBg/edit?utm_content=DAGtJNhpjDg&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton) and [web-based tools](https://docusnap-mock-ui.lovable.app/) to establish a user-friendly foundation. Transitioning to **frontend development**, she built the frontend framework from the ground up, structuring clean interfaces between UI controllers and core functionalities—enabling seamless collaboration for her teammates. She transplanted and refined the workflow based on usability feedback, ensuring intuitive navigation. Her **feature implementations** included frequently used information recommendations, PIN protection for security, and tight integration of local databases and backend calls with responsive UI controls. By bridging design and engineering, she ensured the final product was both visually polished and functionally robust.

## Ziming Zhou

Ziming Zhou primarily contributed to the design and implementation of the in-app job management system. He developed the JobPollingService, which orchestrates background processing of document-related tasks such as scanning, parsing, and autofill. This service continuously polls the backend for job status updates and manages the full lifecycle of jobs across all supported types, including "doc", "form", and "fill". Zhou also implemented the local persistence layer using Android’s Room database, defining core entities such as JobEntity, DocumentEntity, and FormEntity, along with their corresponding DAOs to ensure robust, searchable local storage. From a system design perspective, he played a central role in shaping the app’s modular architecture, enforcing a clean separation between UI, ViewModel, Repository, and Backend layers. He also managed the communication and data synchronization between the asynchronous polling system and the local database to ensure responsiveness and consistency under variable network conditions. In addition, Zhou authored comprehensive documentation for both the frontend and backend systems to support onboarding, collaboration, and long-term maintainability ([Frontend Docs](https://ji-deepsleep.github.io/DocuSnap-Frontend/) · [Backend Docs](https://ji-deepsleep.github.io/DocuSnap-Backend/)).

## Minyang Qu

His core contribution was developing the geometric processing module in pure Kotlin for Android, enabling document standardization for downstream analysis. He implemented a custom automatic corner detector, designed an interactive manual adjustment interface with draggable corners, and built the perspective correction pipeline. This self-contained module formed the foundation for all document preprocessing in the application while optimizing for mobile performance constraints.

## Huijie Tang

His primary contributions centered on developing the application's core image processing engine and unified search functionality. He architected the end-to-end image handling pipeline, from URI ingestion and Bitmap conversion to the non-destructive caching of edited files. Within this pipeline, he implemented advanced image enhancement algorithms in the ImageProcService, including histogram equalization for high-contrast enhancement and Sauvola's adaptive thresholding to process documents in preparation for subsequent OCR text extraction. He implemented the image processing features following the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern, establishing a clean separation between the UI state, the ImageProcessingViewModel, and the underlying ImageProcService. Additionally, he developed the multi-table search feature by aggregating search results from both documents and forms and mapping them into a unified data model for the frontend.

# Challenges

**LLM prompts present a key challenge.** The issues we faced include handling JSON escapes, enforcing the desired JSON structure, preventing extraneous outputs (e.g., "Here's the results of xxx"), and unifying date formats and field names. We built a web mockup for rapid, iterative engineering and tested it on about 20 samples after numerous refinements.  **A key part of our server design is security.** The first version of our server did not use AES. We struggled quite a bit to get RSA and Base64 working. However, performance traces showed that RSA was far too slow for encrypting the payload, so we refactored the entire server and API spec to adopt the current RSA + AES hybrid encryption for both security and performance. This also took a significant amount of time to set up correctly.  **Another performance bottleneck was OCR speed.** This is why we did not opt for a VPS but instead purchased an Orange Pi 5 Pro, which is much more performant. The server is in Zijun's dormitory, and it took considerable effort to expose the service to the internet and configure all the web settings properly. To enable encryption of the app's database and prevent users from modifying imported images in the gallery, we decided to **store images as Base64-encoded strings in the database**. This approach is significantly more complex than the default URI-based image storage provided out-of-the-box, and it requires substantial effort to properly implement reading and writing images from the database. During early UI development before the app's database was ready, we used mock data which later created **challenges when implementing dynamic content with complex control flows**. The control logic proves especially intricate due to background LLM tasks that should trigger UI updates upon receiving results. Furthermore, supporting editing and deletion functionality significantly increases both the complexity and development time of the control logic.

Implementing robust **corner detection** without third-party libraries presented significant hurdles due to imperfect outputs from the self-developed image processing pipeline. The **Canny-style edge detector** frequently generated **discontinuous edges** under challenging lighting conditions, while the **contour finder** produced **irregular polygons** contaminated with noise points. To address these limitations, he designed a **novel corner detection algorithm** that first calculated the contour's **centroid** by averaging all edge points, then identified the initial corner as the point with **maximum distance** to this centroid. The second corner was selected through **maximum distance** measurement to the first corner, while the final corners were determined by finding points with **extreme perpendicular distances** relative to the line connecting the initial corners. This approach demonstrated superior **robustness** to fragmented edges and irregular contours compared to conventional **polygon approximation** methods.
