#  Team Roster and Individual Contribution

## Zijun Yang

His primary contributions to the project included serving as project manager, handling server development, and conducting extensive debugging of the app's backend. As **project manager**, he took ownership of task assignment, app design, feasibility analysis, workload breakdown, and progress tracking. His strategic approach to parallel task delegation enhanced development efficiency, allowing the team to deliver a highly refined application. As the **sole server developer**, he designed and implemented all [server code](https://github.com/JI-DeepSleep/DocuSnap-Backend), which incorporated LLM prompt engineering for all core features, a cache system, an OCR system, security protocols, and an asynchronous request-response model. Completing the server ahead of schedule facilitated smoother app development. In mid-July, he dedicated significant effort to **debugging the app backend**â€”removing mockup data, connecting the app database with the UI, fixing the encryption/decryption and codec module, redesigning the database schema to enable image storage, and ensuring seamless integration of all submodules.
